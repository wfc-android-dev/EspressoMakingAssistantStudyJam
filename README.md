Espresso Making Assistant

This Android App suggests 6 tips to great espresso making. The main
activity screen consists of 6 imagebutton, 6 buttons and a sendmessage
button.

The user interface is rather straight forward. The user will click on
either the imagebutton or button of the specific tip, then a second
activity will be lauched with the detail text about the tip and the
option to send this specific espresso making  tip via email intent.

The sendMessage button at the bottom of the scrollable main activity
view, will gather the information on all 6 tips and allow the user to
send the six tips via email.

The six second activities (for each of the six espesso making tips)
will have a title(TextView), an image (ImageView), the text about the
specific topic (TextView) and finally a button for email intent.

This app does not require permissions. The target sdk is
23(Marshmallow) and the minimum sdk is 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop)
