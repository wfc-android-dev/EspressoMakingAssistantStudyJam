Idea for the Espresso Making Assistant:

  I am a coffee geek that is fond of espresso style of coffee making. I have choosen the following 6 espresso making tips for my android app. They are as the following:
  
  1. Bean Preparation (what kind of grinder is required for proper espresso ground, and how fine to grind the beans)
  2. Bean Selection (Suggestion on what kind of beans to use, however it will be subjective)
  3. Machine Selection (Suggestion on the best machine for the money spent)
  4. Proper Tamping (the amount the force and the procedure involved with tamping)
  5. Brewing Temp (espresso brewing temp)
  6. Extration Time (total espresso extraction time for a double shot espresso 15g -18g)
  
  
  This android app will have a simple 6 imagebuttons (eachbutton for one of the 6 espresso making tips). All images will be converted to png file format and reduce the resolution to 72 dpi for responsiveness. The main layout will have the 6 imagesbuttons, in addition there will be 7 buttons (6 for the 6 espresso making tips, and aligned right below the images buttons / one last button for sending the tips via email intent).
  
  There will be 6 sub-activities launches when the user clicks on either the tip imagebutton or the tip button. Each of the 6 sub-activities will launch a similar view with title of the specific tip, and imageview of the tip, a TextView with the text of the tip, and lastly a button for sending this particular tip information via email intent.
  
  This Android app is target for API 23 (Marshmallow) Android 6.0 and with minimum SDK set to API 21 (Android 5.0 Lollipop).
  
  The app has been tested on AVDs with API 21, 22, 23 plus a real device runing API 22 without issues. The email intent feature is not available with AVDs and should be tested on a real device running API 21 or later.
